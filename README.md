I'm trying to skip continued issues from previous books, like the clothing and Ginny's hair.  ("[Tonks'] hair was tomato-red and waist length today; she looked like Ginny's older sister" (OotP 170).  *Tomato* red.  A simple bottle of hair dye could have given Ginny the correct hair color.)  I also skipped the continued characterization of giving Hermione both her own and Ron's assets, unless notable for a secondary reason as well.


Lots of issues, of course, but let's hit the big ones:


GoF
The Weasleys' tickets to the match were GREAT.  Why was it depicted as being stuck in the nosebleeds.  The top of the stands are the BEST.  As actually occurred, it shows that the Weasleys, though poor with respect to liquid assets, are actually pretty well connected among decent people.

The ridiculous decision to have Beauxbatons all female and Durmstrang all male.

Fred and George FIGHT after the age potion fails.  That's insanely out of character.  They got one look at each other and thought it was hilarious!

Well known, but Dumbledore's apparent anger towards Harry, rather than being so solidly (and calmly) sure that Harry didn't put his name in.  Dumbledore basically assaulted him!

Padma is not in Gryffindor!  It's actually a thing, to show that not all families will be in the same house!  It's by individual, not by blood.  That's a big deal.

As with the fight against Quirrell, the second task again messes with Harry's character.  As shown, Harry submitted to the merpeoples' interference, and then only pulled Gabrielle free because they were gone.  In the text, Harry STOOD UP to them, rather than just being opportunistic.  That is, he showed his pure Gryffindor side, instead of a Gryffindor/Slytherin mix!



Other notes:

Missing the campsite water trip is understandable.  It advanced the Cho storyline and gave some worldbuilding background, but it wasn't necessary.

Not showing the World Cup is understandable.  Doesn't really affect the story, and it'd be a huge time sink.  Story-wise, you mostly lose the Twins' interaction with Bagman and the Veela-related attention to puberty.

The joking around and group chorus after the match - not in the books, but sure.  That's the kind of worldbuilding that's very reasonable for this medium.

The treatment of the Death Eaters' march - understandable, though the hoods are ridiculous.

Taking out Winky was a big deal, as it affects Hermione's overall character development.

Moody and the ceiling is ridiculous.  The DADA lesson, though, was pretty well done, other than Moody throwing something at Seamus.  He's methodical and serious, not out of control.

Hagrid's "No...no..."  ...as usual, more turning him into dumb comic relief.

Much better option: "I leave this to you, Barty.  You know the rules better than anyone. / And they are absolute. ..."  Why not have Dumbledore reference Crouch's expertise and character?

Nearly solidly done on the Skeeter interview.  Not perfect (and there was no reason to change it), but reasonable.  The one serious issue is that she would NOT have printed "age 12."  That would mean Harry hadn't yet been born when Voldemort disappeared.  OBVIOUS error.  She's supposed to be crafty and smart (within her area of expertise) - not a mistake she would make.

What was the point of having Sirius' owl bite?  It serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever, and wastes 4 seconds - better use them for something that matters.

Still not a fan of how they do floo-communication, but that's artistic license.  We know that the faces can be fed toast, so this seems unlikely.

"Magical water plants of the Highland Lochs?"  Because it really needed to be changed from "the Meditteranean?"

Hermione's recitation of how to get the message to Harry was pointless.  It's just "Ron says," the point being that Ron won't tell him directly.  There's no point in having the chain of messages; that it was "revealed" later to be a ruse was idiotic.  The scene also implies that Hermione (and Ginny) are taking Ron's side over Harry's, which isn't the case.

"C'est magnifique" ...about dragons in cages, so you can't even see them?  Not a book-problem, but just dumb.  On the other hand, having Ron know about the dragons turns the spat-between-friends into something actively harmful.  Ron was mad.  In fact, finding out about the dragons is what brought him to his senses!

Cedric's done pretty well.  Included him being against the badges.

Malfoy wouldn't deign to climb a tree.  Ferret scene moved way up - we missed Ron's reaction.  Also, putting the Malfoy-Ferret into Crabbe's pants is just sick.

Reasonble the way they wanted Moody's chest to scream, and they played it off in character well.  Rest of the scene was good, too.

Weasley twins running bets was well done.

Hermione's glom prior to the first task was decent.  Dumbledore being surprised by her presence is out of character - the point is that he pretends to be an absent minded old man, but he sees everything.

The dragon crashing through the professors' tent was pointless, but reasonable for the medium.  The Twins' cheer was in character.  The entire trip around Hogwarts...in a story like this, they had to invent action that wasn't in the book?  They couldn't have stuck to action that actually happened in the story?  Of course, the whole thing about the dragons being brooding mothers who stuck near the egg was completely lost, but that's not a big deal.  ...and the dragon just falls (to its death?)...?  Good job on the banners in the stands, though!

"Who wants me to open it?  You want me to open it?"  Out of character.  Just do it.  Also, Ron's entrance after the party...reasonable given the medium, but it could have happened a scene early.

WHO THE FUCK IS NIGEL?  They couldn't have used any of the other dozen reasonable characters?  Like, oh, I don't know, Colin Creevey?

A learn to dance scene?  Really?  Do the announcement in class, as intended.  Students don't need to be told that a Ball is a dance.  They certainly weren't taught to dance by McGonagall.  Eloise Midgen wasn't in Gryffindor.  (The Twins, again, had a good in-character reaction, though.)  Neville practicing is okay, but him being a decent dancer isn't - he's supposed to be clumsy despite his good intentions.

The following "why do they have to travel in packs" wasn't bad.  They don't make fun of Neville cruelly.  Fred asking Angelina was okay, but a bit overdone even for him.  "Well spotted" was good, but no reason to change the "just because it's taken you..." line.  Harry asking Cho was decent - good job on flubbing the first line, and Cho's reaction was decent.  Skipped that it was Cedric, but that's okay.  Ginny with Ron was fine, but the gaggle of girls following was ridiculous.  Ginny's solid.

Dress robes aren't a tux with an open robe instead of a jacket.  They're ROBES.  The Patils weren't dressed identically.  (But nice job overall on all the ethnic outfits. /s)  The starting dance...eh.  It wasn't terrible, but it needed more Parvati leading, not Harry getting it.  It's a simple dance (so Harry can manage it), not some arm-swapping, pick-up-the-girl thing.

...Rock concert with everyone up except Harry, Ron, and the Patils?  Way overdone.  They weren't dancing, but it wasn't ONLY them.  Ron's "they get scary when they get older...?"  He REALIZED he screwed up (and gave as good as he got UNTIL she brought it up that he had WANTED to ask her), he wasn't trying to antagonize her at the end.

What was the point of having a central thing of water taps in the Prefects' bath, instead of around the edge?  Not a big deal, but just pointless.  The song was fine (though not how I, personally, imagined it).  They couldn't have had Harry glance around the room and notice the mermaid after the song?  Myrtle's creepier than she should have been.

Using Neville to plant the Gillyweed (since they never got back to Dobby) was a decent fix.  Still no reason for Harry to be so cruel in the start of the conversation.  "I sort of have bigger things to worry about" rather than "I don't care" would have been better.

Second task: The stands in the middle of the lake...sure.  Wrong, but a reasonable reinterpretation.  Moody pushing Harry in...they couldn't have shown the gills growing on the platform, then had him jump in?  All the acrobatics...pointless - though in this case, the task WASN'T actually much action (except a brief grindylow event, it was all internal), so it makes sense that they wanted to add some (hence, the Grindylows at the end - it was wrong, but reasonably so).  Ron's reaction to Fleur was good.  Hermione's was good, too.

Crouch meeting with Harry after the task...?  To foreshadow in Crouch-Jr-Moody...fine.

Chair with chains, not some medieval torture device...much less one that requires attendants to screw in spikes by hand (rather than magic!).

Dumbledore continues to be just flat out terrible - it's "maddening" that details slip away?  Dumbledore is CALM and collected.

Good job on the Snape encounter about stealing, though it'd be better to have said "have brewed," not "are brewing," so as to allow the confusion with the potion from CoS.  Laid it on a bit thick by having Snape say polyjuice himself, but that's pretty much necessary for the medium.

Third task: More Filch comic relief, but fine.  Cedric begging Harry to "save" him from the maze?

"I'd introduce you, but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days."  Really?  He .  Also Voldemort explaining the love-shield?  That whole point is that it's not something he'd have ever thought of!  Significant character change.  Voldemort running back and forth?  Far too self-important for that!  Harry's mouthed "no...no..." after Voldemort's announcement about killing him is likewise out of character - it's a big deal that Harry *decided* to face him.  Voldemort was supposed to be shocked (and somewhat afraid) by the twin cores connection, not just vaguely determined.

Moody giving himself away with the graveyard thing...fine.  Wrong, but reasonable.
